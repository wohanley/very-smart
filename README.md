Something people tend to do a lot is give advice when it was neither wanted nor requested (guilty). This is a bot that does that and is easily the biggest asshole of all the bots I've made. The general idea is that it scrapes wikihow articles for titles, which make good topics of advice, and steps from the process described in the article, which make good bits of advice. It uses OpenNLP to extract noun or verb phrases where needed for building coherent sentences.
